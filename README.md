# Resume Processing & Analysis System

A comprehensive machine learning-based system for resume analysis, ranking, fraud detection, and salary prediction. This project demonstrates skills in NLP, machine learning, and web development.

## Features

- **Resume Ranking**: Rank resumes based on job description similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- **Fraud Detection**: Detect potentially fraudulent resumes using Random Forest classifier
- **Salary Prediction**: Predict salary/matched scores using XGBoost regression
- **Resume Clustering**: Group similar resumes using K-Means clustering with PCA dimensionality reduction
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based REST API with HTML frontend

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, NLTK
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **NLP**: TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd nlpog
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download NLTK data:
```python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Train Models

First, you need to train the models using your dataset:

```bash
python resume.py
```

This will:
- Load and analyze the resume dataset
- Train TF-IDF vectorizer
- Train fraud detection model
- Train salary prediction model
- Train clustering model
- Generate all `.pkl` model files

**Note**: Make sure you have `cleaned_resume_dataset.csv` in the project directory.

### Step 2: Run the Web Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask app will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Rank Resumes
```bash
POST /rank
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "job_description": "Software engineer with Python experience",
  "resumes": ["Resume text 1", "Resume text 2", ...]
}
```

#### 2. Detect Fraud
```bash
POST /detect_fraud
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "experience_years": 5
}
```

#### 3. Predict Salary
```bash
POST /predict_salary
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "degree": "Bachelor's in Computer Science",
  "experience_years": 3
}
```

#### 4. Cluster Resumes
```bash
POST /cluster_resumes
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "resumes": ["Resume text 1", "Resume text 2", ...]
}
```

```

## Model Files

The following model files are generated by `resume.py`:
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` - TF-IDF vectorizer for text processing
- `fraud_model.pkl` - Fraud detection model
- `salary_model.pkl` - Salary prediction model
- `resume_cluster_model.pkl` - Clustering model
- `pca_model.pkl` - PCA model for dimensionality reduction
- `label_encoder.pkl` - Label encoder for degree names

**Note**: These files are excluded from git (see `.gitignore`). You need to generate them by running `resume.py`.

## Dataset Requirements

Your CSV file should contain the following columns:
- `career_objective` - Resume career objective text
- `experience_years` - Years of experience
- `degree_names` - Educational degree
- `matched_score` - Target variable for salary prediction
- `passing_years` - Year of graduation (for fraud detection)

## Limitations & Future Improvements

- Current fraud detection is basic - could be enhanced with more features
- Salary prediction uses limited features - could include location, industry, etc.
- No authentication/authorization in the web app
- Frontend is basic - could be improved with modern frameworks
- No database integration - models are loaded from files
